/**
 * @title Radium ERC20 Token MintStore
 * @author John R. Kosinski
 * 
 * @dev This contract handles only the selling and minting functionality of the Radium token. 
 * I prefer to keep the logic of commerce loosely coupled from the core logic of what the 
 * ERC20 is. 
 * 
 * The MintStore is coupled to the Radium token by calling the Radium token contract's 
 * setDesignatedMinter method, and passing in the address of the MintStore. In the future 
 * another contract could be substituted for this one without needing to break the core Radium 
 * logic. This relies on Radium implementing { IMintable }. 
 * 
 * See the README for more details. 
 * 
 * - Any address can buy tokens. 
 * 
 * - Only contract owner may withdraw funds from this contract. 
 * 
 * - The IMintable (token) address is specified on construction and cannot be changed.
 * 
 * - This contract may only mint an IMintable for which it has been granted permission 
 * to mint. Therefore permission is two-way; this contract must hold the address of the 
 * IMintable, and the IMintable must allow this contract to be a minter. 
 * 
 * - This contract can be disabled by revoking its permissions to mint, on the token contract.
 * Pausing the token contract will also effectively disable purchasing/minting.
