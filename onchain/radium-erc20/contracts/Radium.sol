 * @title Radium ERC20 Token

 * 
 * @dev Requirements: 
 * 
 * - An initial total supply of 10,000,000.
 * 
 * - A buying cost of 0.01 ETH per BAD.
 * 
 * - The contract owner can burn all tokens belonging to ALL holders, at any time.
 * 
 * - The contract owner can burn any tokens belonging to ANY individual holders, at any time. 
 * 
 * - The owner can mint an arbitrary amount of tokens at any time. 
 * 
 * - The owner can transfer tokens from one address to another whitelisted address. 
 * 
 * - The owner can specify and modify a whitelist of eligible receivers. Once bought by users,
 * tokens can be transferred only to those addresses. 
 * 
 * - Non-whitelisted addresses CAN purchase tokens from the store, but they can only transfer
 * them to whitelisted addreses. Therefore, it is possible for non-whitelisted addresses 
 * to hold tokens.
